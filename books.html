          <h3><strong>Shoeless Joe</strong> by W. P. Kinsella</h3>
          This is the lyrical novel from 1982 about baseball, love, fathers and sons, 
          writing, self-discovery, and (of course) Shoeless Joe Jackson. You know it from
            Kevin Costnerâ€™s <strong>Field of Dreams</strong> (1989), which moved me when 
            I first saw it (in my mid-20s), but the book is so much richer, deeper, 
            and more magical.

          <h3><strong>Cat's Cradle</strong> by Kurt Vonnegut</h3>
          <strong>Cat's Cradle</strong> offers the best of Vonnegut's well-known satire and 
          absurdity contained in a compelling and forward-moving story. This novel sheds 
          light on so many aspects of human behavior - our tribalism, our need for purpose, 
          religion, the lies we tell ourselves and each other, our arrogance and short-sightedness, 
          and our profound potential to destroy ourselves. Hilarious and devastating.

          <h3><strong>Man's Search for Meaning</strong> by Viktor Frankl</h3>
          Frankl lost everything in the Nazi concentration camps, including his career, his wife, 
          his wealth and his possessions. Everything <strong>except</strong> the ability to choose 
          his response, which is one of the main themes of this powerful book. A key lesson: 
          We shouldn't ask "What is the meaning of life?" but instead realize that we are the ones 
          being asked.

          <h3><strong>What it is Like to go to War</strong> by Karl Marlantes (read by Bronson Pinchot)</h3>
          Marlantes is a wise and insightful narrator of not only his Vietnam experiences but 
          also the of his struggles and growth in the lifetime since he came home. Actor 
          <strong>Bronson Pinchot</strong> brings the narrative to life with a fantastic performance 
          (and those who remember him in <em>Beverly Hills Cop</em> will enjoy noting the difference 
          in his pronunciation of the name "Axel").

        <h3><strong>The Great Gatsby</strong> by F. Scott Fitzgerald (read by Anthony Heald)</h3>
        Gatsby has so much to say about America, even a century after it was written. It addresses 
        our class distinctions, old money vs. new, celebrity worship, the protections that riches 
        offer vs. the limitations for those born poor - and all of this in a story that is often 
        funny, sometimes tragic, and always perfectly written. Actor <strong>Anthony Heald</strong> 
        gets this performance just right (as he does in all the books he reads).

        <h3><strong>Heart of Darkness</strong> by Joseph Conrad (read by Kenneth Branagh)</h3>
        I tried and failed in college to get through this short novel on British colonialism in 
        Africa. But I got interested again after falling for <strong>Apocalypse Now</strong> 
        (which is loosely based on <em>Heart of Darkness</em>), and this wonderful rendition by 
        British actor and director Kenneth Branagh pulls you into and through this study of 
        power, ambition, greed, madness, and what makes us (and keeps us) human.
