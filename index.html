                        These are the times that try men’s souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; 
                        but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation 
                        with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. <strong>What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that 
                        gives every thing its value.</strong> Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article

                        <strong>An age of happiness is quite impossible, because men want only to desire it but not to have it</strong>, and every individual who experiences good times learns to 
                        downright pray for misery and disquietude. <strong>The destiny of man is designed for happy moments - every life has them - but not for happy ages.

                        for the concepts of the age of happiness was no doubt acquired in primeval times from that condition of which, after violent exertion in hunting 
                        and warfare, man gives himself up to repose, stretches his limbs and hears the pinions of sleep rustling about him. It is a false conclusion if, 
                        in accordance with that ancient familiar experience, man imagines that, after whole ages of toil and deprivation, he can then partake of that condition
