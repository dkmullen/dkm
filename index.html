    <p class="left">I was a minister for many years. Now I think that the greatest virtues are things like <strong>Rationality, 
      Discipline, Compassion,</strong> and <strong>Respect</strong>. I have also been influenced by the writings
      of the <a href="https://ryanholiday.net/stoicism-a-practical-philosophy-you-can-actually-use/" 
      target="_blank">Stoics</a>, and by their four main virtues, <a href="https://dailystoic.com/4-stoic-virtues/"
      target="_blank">Courage, Temperance, Justice, and Wisdom</a>.
      </p>

    <div class="link-section">
      <p class="left">I went into the ministry out of a desire to stand up for truth, and to discover
        more of it. I was probably more successful with the second than the first. In my search for 
        more truth, I discovered the wonderful Seth Godin, who often writes about marketing, but 
        sometimes touches on why we believe things, and how beliefs (regardless of their veracity) 
        tie us to others and give us meaning. This is what he does in <a 
        href="https://seths.blog/2020/09/dancing-with-belief/"target="_blank">Dancing With Belief</a>, 
        <a href="https://seths.blog/2020/11/a-paradox-of-community-belief-and-reality/"target="_blank">
          A Paradox of Community, Belief and Reality</a>, and <a href="https://seths.blog/2021/01/belief-and-knowledge/"
          target="_blank">Belief and Knowledge</a>. Seth Godin writes (in a way I wish I could) that our most firmly-held 
          beliefs are about many things other than the actual state of reality. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="left">In my ongoing struggle toward virtue, my frequent companion and antagonist 
        has been anger. Somewhere I heard Seth Godin (again) say that "You are almost never right 
        to be angry," but I have lost the source. But Ryan Holiday writes about a similar idea in <a href=
        "https://dailystoic.com/anger-is-a-kind-of-madness/" target="_blank">Anger is a Kind of Madness</a>.

        To change tone, here is some of my favorite music on the web. We'll start with John Legend's 
        wonderful cover of Springsteen's <a href="https://youtu.be/FszBbfxDn4o" target="_blank">Dancing in the Dark</a>. And 
        because he is on Howard Stern, he sounds amazing. This one brought out the lyrics to me more than 
        the original;

      <p class="left">
        I loved Tom Petty's album Full Moon Fever back in the beforetime, but John Mayer (with some help) 
        brings something wonderful to <a href="https://youtu.be/20Ov0cDPZy8" target="_blank">Free Fallin'</a>. Amazing.</div>
      </p>
      <p class="left">I mentioned that every musical artist sounds great on Howard Stern. In my more 
        emotional moments, I like to say that this cover of Fleetwood Mac's <a href="https://youtu.be/jVLNB3d-2cA" target="_blank">The Chain by 
        The Highwomen</a> is the greatest recording in history. It sounds SOOOO good.
      </p>
      <p class="left">
        My wife introduced me to the Tedeschi Trucks Band, a great band headed by singer Susan Tedeschi and her husband, 
        guitarist Derek Trucks. I could listen for hours to any of their performances of <a href=
        "https://youtu.be/-wVWjl9Kq6U" target="_blank">Midnight in Harlem</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="left">
        Here's John Legend again, doing justice to the Simon and Garfunkel classic, 
        <a href="https://youtu.be/WnCHCqYRQFs" target="_blank">Bridge Over Troubled Water</a>.
