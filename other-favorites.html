          <strong>Nick Cave</strong> is a well-known and much-loved musician. I know very 
          little about his music. But Cave's writing at The Red Hand Files is astonishingly 
          great. Here he answers letters from fans, often addressing the most painful 
          questions with wisdom, grace and lots of hope. Cave is an everyday sage, 
          an old soul, a man who has lived with his eyes open. Some of his best letters 
          weave several unrelated questions in a cohesive answer, such as 
          <a href="https://www.theredhandfiles.com/do-you-work-out-before-you-go-on-tour/" 
          target="_blank"> this one about a chance meeting with drummer Charlie Watts</a>. 
          Other favorites of mine include
            <a href="https://www.theredhandfiles.com/aunt-marnie-grief/" target="_blank">
            this one about a grieving mother</a>, and
            <a href="https://www.theredhandfiles.com/stagger-me/" target="_blank">this 
              gracious and hopeful response to a struggling fan</a>.

        If the world was hooked up right, the people who made <strong>Yacht Rock</strong> 
        would all be succesful Hollywood creators. In the mid-2000s, before the iPhone, 
        before YouTube, Yacht Rock was spun into existence as a professional-grade, 
        clever, hilarious, and loving triute to the "really smooth music" of the 70s 
        and 80s. In ten short episodes (you can watch them all in an hour), you'll
        see an alternate take on the history of gentle grooves that includes Loggins, 
        Michael McDonald, Hall and Oates, Steeley Dan, Christopher Cross and 
        Michael Jackson. You might have to jump around to hit all ten episodes, but do it.
