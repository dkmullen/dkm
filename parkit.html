    <p class="left">
      I am a self-taught web developer<a href="#self-taught">*</a> who has been working professionally in the field since early 2018. The bulk of my work so far has been <strong>1) Developing a Web UI (in Angular) for TrueNAS</strong>, the open-source storage and networking product, and <strong>2) building web apps (in Vue and Laravel, using AWS)</strong> that citizens use to access local government services. See my full resume here.
    </p>


    <p class="left">I was a minister for many years. Now I think that the greatest virtues are things like <strong>Rationality, 
      Discipline, Compassion,</strong> and <strong>Respect</strong>. I have also been influenced by the writings
      of the <a href="https://ryanholiday.net/stoicism-a-practical-philosophy-you-can-actually-use/" 
      target="_blank">Stoics</a>, and by their four main virtues, <a href="https://dailystoic.com/4-stoic-virtues/"
      target="_blank">Courage, Temperance, Justice, and Wisdom</a>.
      </p>

    <div class="link-section">
      <p class="left">I went into the ministry out of a desire to stand up for truth, and to discover
        more of it. I was probably more successful with the second than the first. In my search for 
        more truth, I discovered the wonderful Seth Godin, who often writes about marketing, but 
        sometimes touches on why we believe things, and how beliefs (regardless of their veracity) 
        tie us to others and give us meaning. This is what he does in <a 
        href="https://seths.blog/2020/09/dancing-with-belief/"target="_blank">Dancing With Belief</a>, 
        <a href="https://seths.blog/2020/11/a-paradox-of-community-belief-and-reality/"target="_blank">
          A Paradox of Community, Belief and Reality</a>, and <a href="https://seths.blog/2021/01/belief-and-knowledge/"
          target="_blank">Belief and Knowledge</a>. Seth Godin writes (in a way I wish I could) that our most firmly-held 
          beliefs are about many things other than the actual state of reality. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="left">In my ongoing struggle toward virtue, my frequent companion and antagonist 
        has been anger. Somewhere I heard Seth Godin (again) say that "You are almost never right 
        to be angry," but I have lost the source. But Ryan Holiday writes about a similar idea in <a href=
        "https://dailystoic.com/anger-is-a-kind-of-madness/" target="_blank">Anger is a Kind of Madness</a>.

        I'm still not familiar with Nick Cave's music, but last month I followed a link to his site of 
        responses to letters, <a href="https://www.theredhandfiles.com" target="_blank">The Red Hand 
        Files</a>. What a beautiful expression of wisdom, compassion, and honesty is this collection. 
        Among my favorites are <a href="https://www.theredhandfiles.com/aunt-marnie-grief/" target="_blank">
        this one about a grieving mother</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.theredhandfiles.com/do-you-work-out-before-you-go-on-tour/" target="_blank">
        this humorous yet poignant one about meeting Charlie Watts</a>, and 
        <a href="https://www.theredhandfiles.com/stagger-me/" target="_blank">this gracious and hopeful 
        response to a struggling fan</a>.

        * Who is really “self-taught” though, in a world so rich in free and low-cost technical education online, not to mention the generosity of developers willing to share their own solutions to almost any problem?!
